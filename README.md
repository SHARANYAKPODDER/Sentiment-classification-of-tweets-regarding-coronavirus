# Sentiment-classification-of-tweets-regarding-coronavirus
Sentiment classification of Tweets is the task of computationally classifying tweets depending on their
arrangements of words and contents. It is also a task of significantly categorizing the opinion expressed
in the text, i.e., Tweet, to determine the writerâ€™s attitude to the particular topics. COVID-19 is the
Corona Virus Disease of 2019, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in
March 2020. Facebook, blogs, Instagram and Twitter and other social media platforms have become
places where people post their opinions on specific topics. The objective is to classify the tweets
into the following classes: extremely positive, positive, neutral, negative and extremely negative.

I have done the above course project during my course-work "Natural Language Processing(DSE407)" while studying at Indian Institute of Science Educatioon and Research(IISER) Bhopal in the 3rd year of my BS in Data Science. In this course project my teammate was Saswata Sarkar, he has done the EDA, data preprocessing, text mining part and rest of the code including various ML models using GridSearchCV and the comparisons was done by me.
